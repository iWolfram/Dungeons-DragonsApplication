# Dungeons & Dragons Application
## Description
This is my final project for the Android Development course I took at Northern Alberta Institue of Technology (NAIT). It is a simple
dice roller that allows a user to either tap on the "ROLL" button or by shaking the mobile device. I was more focused on the design of
the application as opposed to the functionality.
